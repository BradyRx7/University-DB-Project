This is a simple MVC app created for my java programming class INFO3010 at UML Fall 2017

It utilizes MVC model application theory, xml document factory, java swing library with some AWT as well. 
Serializable classes and most of the basic data structures.

I may updated it to a maven app and add traditional source directory trees.

As of 12-10-17 XML document model does not work to read in data yet and even though most of save fuction is done it is not yet fully
complete
